- The ```riscv_sta.tcl``` file is used for sta analysis using opensource tool ``OpenSTA``. We use the following command to execute OpenSTA ```sta <tcl file>```. At present the tcl file is use for sta analysis of ``Post_Synthesis``stage across the different skywater130 PDK. The TCL script shall be modified for sta analysis across other PnR stages.
